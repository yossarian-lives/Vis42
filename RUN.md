### Analysis Modes

**Basic Analysis**: Traditional visibility scoring with 5 core metrics
- Recognition, Media, Context, Competitors, Consistency
- Single query per provider
- Fast results (15-30 seconds)

**Mission-Critical Analysis**: Advanced multi-variant approach
- 5 specialized query types: Recognition, Ranking, Sentiment, Frequency, Comparison
- Multiple queries per provider for bias reduction
- Comprehensive scoring including share of voice and market position
- LinkedIn-ready results with sentiment breakdown
- Enhanced reporting (60-90 seconds)

### Key Metrics

1. **Mention Frequency** (30% weight) - How often the brand appears in LLM responses
2. **Market Ranking** (25% weight) - Position relative to competitors in top-10 lists
3. **Sentiment Analysis** (20% weight) - Positive/neutral/negative perception
4. **Brand Recognition** (15% weight) - Basic awareness and identification
5. **Competitive Strength** (10% weight) - Market differentiation and advantages

### Query Best Practices (Built-in)

- **Neutral Prompts**: Unbiased, informational queries
- **Multiple Variants**: 5 different query types to reduce prompt bias
- **Consistency Checks**: Cross-validation across providers
- **Anchor Brands**: Baseline entities for sanity checking
- **Frequency Sampling**: Multiple runs for statistical significance

## üîß Configuration Options

### API Keys
- **OpenAI**: Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Mission-Critical Analysis Workflow
1. **Enter entity**: "Vuori" (automatically normalized from "VOURI")
2. **Select mode**: "Mission-Critical Analysis"
3. **Choose providers**: OpenAI + Anthropic + Gemini
4. **Run analysis**: 5 query variants √ó 3 providers = 15 total queries
5. **Review results**: Comprehensive scoring with LinkedIn sharing
6. **Export/Share**: Download report or share on LinkedIn

### Query Types Executed
1. **Recognition**: "How well do you know Vuori in the activewear space?"
2. **Ranking**: "List top 10 activewear companies, include Vuori if applicable"
3. **Sentiment**: "What are the strengths and weaknesses of Vuori?"
4. **Frequency**: "How often does Vuori appear in activewear discussions?"
5. **Comparison**: "Compare Vuori with main activewear competitors"

### Scoring Calculation
```
Frequency: 65% mention rate = 65 points
Ranking: #3 position = 80 points  
Sentiment: Positive overall = 75 points
Recognition: High accuracy = 85 points
Competitive: Strong differentiation = 70 points

Overall = (65√ó0.3 + 80√ó0.25 + 75√ó0.2 + 85√ó0.15 + 70√ó0.1) = 74.25 ‚âà 74/100
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **"Import error"**: Ensure all files are in correct directories per structure above
- **"No API key"**: Set environment variables or add to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
- **"Analysis failed"**: Check API keys have credits and correct permissions
- **"Timeout"**: Network issues or API rate limits, try fewer providers

### Debug Mode
Enable in sidebar to see:
- Provider availability and key status
- Query execution details
- Error messages with suggestions
- Fallback trigger reasons

### Performance Tips
- **Basic mode**: Use for quick checks (15-30 seconds)
- **Mission-critical mode**: Use for comprehensive analysis (60-90 seconds)
- **Single provider**: Faster results, less comprehensive
- **Multiple providers**: Slower but more reliable and bias-reduced
